# COVID-19 Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and data files for a COVID-19 analysis project. The project utilizes SQL, Python, and Tableau for data extraction, analysis, and visualization respectively. The aim of this project is to analyze various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data and present insights through visualizations.

## Project Components
- **SQL Queries**: SQL queries are used to extract data from the provided database, which contains COVID-19 related data.
- **Python Scripts**: Python scripts are utilized for data preprocessing, analysis, and generating insights from the extracted data.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Tableau is used to create interactive visualizations to showcase the analyzed data and insights in a more understandable and intuitive manner.

## Project Structure
- **`Data_Exploration_Using_SQL/`**: This directory contains SQL scripts used to extract data from the database.
- **`python/`**: This directory contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and generating insights.
- **`Tableau/`**: Contains Tableau workbooks and visualization files.
- **`Datsets/`**: This directory contains any additional data files required for the analysis.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use the code and reproduce the analysis.
